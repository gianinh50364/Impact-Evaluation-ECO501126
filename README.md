| Thanh (2008)   | WTP is sufficient to cover household costs for public health care, it depends to what extent households would substitute private for public care and increase utilization as to whether WTP would also be sufficient enough to finance health insurance |
| Nguyen (2012)  | Insurance reform reduced household vulnerability to high health care costs through direct reduction of medical costs and indirect reduction of income lost to illness.                                                                                  |
| Shafie (2013)  | Most Malaysians are willing to join the proposed VCHI and to pay an average of Int$114.38 per month per household for the plan                                                                                                                          |
| Wang (2013)    | Heath insurance was not utilized for 12.6% (inpatient), 53.3% (outpatient), and 72.6% (self-treatment) of disease episodes. Subjectsâ€™ characteristics were associated with insurance utilization. Inpatient and outpatient treatments were expensive    |
| Kaiser (2015)  | The program had positive effects on employment and wages the year individuals participate in the program                                                                                                                                                |
| Dauth (2020)   | training subsidies significantly increase cumulative employment duration and earnings in the short run and middle run for compliers, that is, those workers who additionally participate due to a more generous policy style in their agency            |
| Martins (2021) | significant positive effects on take up (training hours and expenditure), with limited deadweight; and that such additional training led to increased sales, value added, employment, productivity, and exports                                         |
